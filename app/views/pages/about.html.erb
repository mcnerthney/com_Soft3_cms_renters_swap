<p><strong>Our Industry - Collaborative Consumption</strong>

<p>According to Rachel Botsman, a leading expert on collaborative consumption, if the 20th century was defined by hyper consumption, the 21st century will be defined by collaborative consumption.

<p><strong>Collaborative consumption revolution might be as significant as the industrial revolution</strong>

<p>According to Tech Crunch, “Everything, it seems, is becoming collaborative. From Airbnb to RentCycle to Zipcar, we are swapping our cars, our homes, even our clothes with each other. According to Lauren Anderson from Collaborative Consumption, this change might be as profound as the industrial revolution, in a world driven by “reputational capital” in which the “We” of the our collaborative age will replace the “Me” of the industrial age.”

<p>Collaborative consumption describes the rapid explosion in traditional sharing, bartering, lending, trading, renting, gifting, and swapping reinvented through network technologies on a scale and in ways never possible before.

<p>We are excited to be part of this movement, and believe as others do, that collaborating is powerful, fun, and the right thing to do in today’s day and age.
