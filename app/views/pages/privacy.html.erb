<h2>PRIVACY</h2>

<p>RentSwap.org ("RentSwap.org", "we" or "us") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.RentSwap.org, (collectively, the "Site") and our application. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site and Application. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your RentSwap.org Account) or by means of a notice on the Site and Application prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (http://www.RentSwap.org/terms).
<p>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
<p><b>International Transfer</b></p>
<p>YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO - AND MAINTAINED ON - COMPUTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF YOUR STATE, PROVINCE, COUNTRY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTION WHERE THE PRIVACY LAWS MAY NOT BE AS PROTECTIVE AS THOSE IN YOUR JURISDICTION. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CHOOSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US, RENTSWAP.ORG TRANSFERS PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROCESSES IT THERE. YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY FOLLOWED BY YOUR SUBMISSION OF SUCH INFORMATION REPRESENTS YOUR AGREEMENT TO THAT TRANSFER.
<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site and Application (together, the "Service") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Application.
<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
<p>When you register with us through the Site or Application and become a Member and when you choose to post a Listing or book a Rental, or when you wish to contact another Member, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Identity Information"). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address, and home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. Some Personal Information is required, like your name and email address, and other Personal Information is optional, like your date of birth. We reserve the right to require address confirmation for Rentals included in Listings. If we require such confirmation, we will send a code via postal mail to the address contained in a Listing and ask you to enter the code via the Site, Application and Service in order to confirm the address of the Rental included in the applicable Listing. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.
<p>We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join the Service. You can register to join via the Site or Application by completing the required forms.
<p>To register at RentSwap.org, you must sign up or have a Facebook account, before you can be part of the RentSwap.org community. Facebook.com is a Third Party service provider ("SNS"). As part of the functionality of the Site, Service and Application, you must link your RentSwap.org Account with Third Party Account, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to RentSwap.org through the Site, Service or Application; or (ii) allowing RentSwap.org to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to RentSwap.org and/or grant RentSwap.org access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating RentSwap.org to pay any fees or making RentSwap.org subject to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable SNS. If you decide to register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Site or Application, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the applicable SNS (such as your "real" name, email address, profile picture, names of SNS friends, names of SNS groups to which you belong, other information you make publicly available via the applicable SNS and/or other information you authorize RentSwap.org to access by authorizing the SNS to provide such information) from your Third Party Account and use that information to create your RentSwap.org Account and RentSwap.org Account profile page and you will become a Member. You are subject to the privacy settings that you have set in Third Party Account, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Account, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the SNS and authorized by you) the information in your Third Party Account so that it is available on and through your RentSwap.org Account on the Site, Service and Application. If there is information about your "friends" or people with whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain about those "friends" or people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable SNS.
<p>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your RentSwap.org Account profile (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences or demographic information) ("Non-Identifying Information").
<p>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.
<p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your demographic information). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other RentSwap.org Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site, Application and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
<p>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with RentSwap.org newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications.
<p><b>Log Data</b></p>
<p>When you visit the Site and Application, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Application, pages of our Site and Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, Application and the Service and for the Site and Application's technical administration, to increase our Site and Application's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
<p><b>Cookies</b><p>
<p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by RentSwap.org Users and web traffic routing on the Site and Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Application and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site and Application may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or Application or all functionality of the Service.
<p><b>Web Beacons</b></p>
<p>Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site and Application are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.
<p><b>Emailing Via RentSwap.org Account</b></p>
<p>As part of the Service, RentSwap.org Users may communicate with RentSwap.org Members through use of the "Contact" feature on the Site and Application. 
<p><b>Phishing</b></p>
<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to RentSwap.org. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your RentSwap.org Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov.
<p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></p>
<p>The Site, Application and Service can be used to facilitate the listing and booking of Rentals. Listings for such Rentals are made available via the Site, Application and Service by Owners. 
<p><b>RentSwap.org Members and Users</b></p>
<p>When you create a RentSwap.org Account, we will set up a RentSwap.org Account profile page for you. Your RentSwap.org Account profile page will include your first name and last initial. You can select the other items of Personal Information that you wish to be included in your RentSwap.org Account profile page – including, but not limited to, a profile picture, a list of the SNS groups to which you belong, a list of any of your SNS friends or connections who are also Members of RentSwap.org, connections you have established between your Account and any SNSs, and a biography and links to your Listings, if applicable (together, your "Profile Information"). We will display your Profile Information in your RentSwap.org Account profile page publicly via the Site and Application, and, with your prior permission, on third party sites. Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile Information will be publicly visible to all RentSwap.org Users and consequently should reflect how much you want other RentSwap.org Users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your Profile Information at any time.
<p><b>Listings</b></p>
<p>If you post a Listing, we may publish that Listing publicly via the Site and Application and may enable third parties to publish your Listing on their websites through the use of an HTML "widget". We may also display the geographical location of your Listing in the form of a map so that potential users can see the general area and neighborhood of your Listing, based on the information you are comfortable providing. 
<p><b>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</b><p>
We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
Service Providers
<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site and Application-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, fraud detection services relating to the activity of RentSwap.org Users and improvement of the Site and Application's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site, Application and Service are used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information; if they do, this access is only so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on RentSwap.org User's prior visits to RentSwap.org. You can disable these specific cookies that track prior visits for the sake of follow-up advertising by opting out at http://www.google.com/privacyads.html.

<p>All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us at info@RentSwap.org or editing the relevant part of their profile. If you would like us to cancel your RentSwap.org Account, please contact us, and we will attempt to accommodate your request, if we do not have any legal obligation or a legitimate business reason to retain the information contained in your RentSwap.org Account.

<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>RentSwap.org is very concerned with safeguarding your information. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<p>Our Site and Application contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
